# LEDTile

A 32x32 LED tile that I hung up on my wall.  Uses a Terasic DE0-Nano FPGA with a Nios II core soft CPU and a custom circuitboard.

### Prerequisites

* Quartus Prime 16.1 Lite Edition
* A Terasic DE0-Nano FPGA or something like it
* My circuit or something else to power the board and FPGA and connect them together

### About the Terasic DE0-Nano

Of interest to this project, the board contains...

* Altera Cyclone IV EP4CE22F17C6N
* 32MB SDRAM
* 64Mb EPCS64 serial configuration device
* 50 MHz oscillator
* 72 IO pins
* On-board USB Blaster circuit
